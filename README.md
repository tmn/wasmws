# wasm workshop

**A beginner level intro to WebAssembly!**

WebAssembly is a binary format for executing code on the web.

## Agenda

## What?

WebAssembly is a portable, size- and load-time-efficient binary format for executing code on the web.

### What is `emscripten`?

Emscripten is a LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. It works as a back-end to the LLVM compiler.


## Why?

...


## The MVP

_"A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the standard with roughly the same functionality as asm.js, primarily aimed at C/C++"_





## Getting started

Before we get started compiling our first program to WebAssembly we need to compile the LLVM from source. [This guide](http://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/) will run you through the whole setup process.
